This is the README file for the final assignment of the *Getting and Cleaning
Data* course.

The assignment is based
on data collected for the following project by the following researchers: \newline


Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0

A detailed description of their study is available here:

<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones> \newline

The experiment had 30 subjects perform 6 different activities
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
multiple times while collecting data on several parameters through their
smartphones.
The dataset was then divided into a training set (70% of the participants)
and a test set (30% of the participants) at random.


The repo includes the following files:

- *README.txt*

- *run_analysis.R*, the script

- *Codebook.Rmd*, the codebook for this project


The script downloads the raw data files, imports them and cleans/edits them
to create one tidy final dataset and one summary dataset.
